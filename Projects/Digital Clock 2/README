- A user can set a countdown timer  and rest the it set new one.
- This interaction of user can be happened with help of JavaScript

- In JS, 
- we have declared a variable named startTimer()  which contain a null value means a user has not set a timer.

- JS Code contain addEventListener() functions which helps to set a countdown time a user want.

- A function called addEventListener() contains a another function that is startInterval() this is the onclick function 

that means when user click on the 'Start' button it is being called  and starts the countdown timer from the time you have set.

- When a user click on the 'Reset' button the another function is being called that is stopInterval()
