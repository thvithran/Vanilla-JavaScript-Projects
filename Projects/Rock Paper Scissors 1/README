The HTML Layout:

HTML gives the basic structure of the game. styles.css file is linked in the head tag which will be used for styling the HTML.

Description of elements use in code is below:

- A div with the class title is used to display the title on the screen.
- A div with a class score contains two more div which will display the score of the player and computer.
- Div with the class move just displays a text and div with class moves left will show the number of moves left before the game ends.

The logic using JavaScript:

The main logic of the game is created by using JavaScript. We will be performing DOM manipulation so basic knowledge of JavaScript is enough to build the game.

- Create a function game() that will contain all the logic of the game.
- Inside the function declare three variables playerScore, computerScore, moves which will keep the record of the player’s score,         
   computer’s score, and moves completed respectively.
- Create a function playGame() and inside the function use DOM manipulation to get hold of all the three buttons we created in HTML for 
  player input. Create an array playerOptions which will contain all three buttons as its elements. Similarly, create an array for computer options.
- Use forEach() loop on playerOptions so that we can add an event listener on all buttons with a single piece of code. Inside the loop 
  increment moves counter by 1 display moves left on the screen by subtracting moves from 10. Generate a random value for the computer option and compare it with the player’s input.
- Create a function winner() which will receive two arguments one the player’s input and the other the computer’s option  The function 
  will decide who wins the point among the player and computer.
- Create a function gameOver() which will display the final result with reload button. The function will be called when moves will become 
   equals to 10.
- Call the playGame() function inside the game() function.
- Now call the game() function at the end of the file.
